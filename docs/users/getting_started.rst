Getting started
===============

Terminator is a web app that allows you to manage terminology more easily.
Terminator is GPL licensed Free Software, and you can download it and run your
own copy if you like.

You can also help participate in the development in many ways (you don't have
to be able to program).

The Terminator project itself is hosted at
https://github.com/translate/terminator/ where you can find details about
source code, mailing lists, etc.
